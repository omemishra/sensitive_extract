# sensitive_extract


This code is a Python script for automating the reconnaissance process in web application security testing. It performs several tasks, including subdomain enumeration, sensitive information extraction from JavaScript files, directory brute-forcing, and searching for sensitive directories and files. The script uses several popular open-source tools such as subfinder, gau, gf, httprobe, nmap, and dirsearch to perform these tasks. It also uses notify-send to send notifications to the user's desktop environment when certain events occur, such as finding sensitive information or discovering an internal website accessible from the external network. The script takes a target domain as an argument and outputs progress information to the terminal.
